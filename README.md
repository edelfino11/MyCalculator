Welcome!

Here is a small arithmetic calculator built with REACT.JS library.

How to run it on your local machine :
1 - Clone this repo into your directory of choice
2 - Check that you have npm downloaded, if not check this link [download vpm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
3 - npm install
4 - npm start

If it npm doesn't automatically redirect you open http://localhost:3000/ after npm start

Take a quick look:
