Welcome!

Here is a small arithmetic calculator built with the React library.

How to run it on your local machine :
- Clone this repo into your directory of choice
- Check that you have npm downloaded, if not check this link [download npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- npm install
- npm start

If npm doesn't automatically redirect you open http://localhost:3000/ after running npm start

Take a quick look:
